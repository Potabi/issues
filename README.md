# Issues
This is where all issues are reported. To open a new issue, please do not submit a pull request with your issue, but instead rather use the issue tab. This is to document all issues with the operating system for contributors to easily get the information we need.

### For developers and contributors
Please properly sort into `open` and 'closed` directories. All documents will be written in markdown for reasons of consistancy.
